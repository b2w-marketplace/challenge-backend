# Challenge B2W - SQL

My query is in the file 'script_resolution' and and the results in the 'result.xml' file;

I made an 'internal join' by 'event_type' and for each 'eventy_type' I made two selects, 
to obtain the oldest value and the penultimate value. With both values I subtracted and got the 'value'.
